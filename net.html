      <h1>Project 4 Net Art</h1>
      <p>My net art project is a narrative text based game called “Don’t Stay Silent” created using html. In the game you are presented with a series of common social scenarios a student may come across. For each scenario you are given the choice to either start a social engagement or stay silent. The title implies the goal is to not stay silent, however this is unachievable. This inability to complete the objective is intentional in order to instill the sense of futility a person with social anxiety may experience in such situations. The game is meant to let the player understand or sympathize with those less socially inclined by putting them in their position. The gloomy visuals and audio support the overall mood of the subject. My game subverts the common gaming convention of being able to choose your own path. Instead of individual choices leading to separate endings like many modern games, there is only one ending in “Don’t Stay Silent.” In the game you can choose different decisions to make, however those decisions do not ultimately matter. My game is designed to lure the player into initially believing they can succeed only to strip away their ability to do so. This mirrors the message of the game on social anxiety. The game is not a critique on society, nor is its main goal to bring awareness to the issue on hand. The purpose of the game is to simply convey to the player what social anxiety can be like. The technical side of the projects consists of an animated gif with text that is image mapped. The audio was embedded and set to autoplay with hidden controls. Some javascript was also used in order to scale the image map with the image dynamically. The composition of my project was derived from my intention to avoid formatting text on the html page as I am not a strong coder. Instead I photoshopped text onto my gif and image mapped the text to function as buttons.</p>
