      <h1>Seasons, Digital Video, 600x600, 37 seconds</h1>
      <p>This motion graphics piece was inspired by the passage of time. I was thinking of the way in which our perception of time ramps up as we get older. Although I am still in my early years, I sometimes feel like time is slipping away faster and faster with every passing year. In this piece I use simple shapes and motion to convey the seasons as they pass us by one after another. I wanted to convey the fleeting nature of time. This feeling is especially prevalent during times of monotony and repetition, hence the cycle of the seasons remaining unchanged throughout the video. This video was produced during the quarantine of the covid-19 outbreak in which my life, and many others seemingly became a drone of repetition and stagnation in daily life.</p>
