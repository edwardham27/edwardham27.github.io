      <h1>Art is This, Video For Installation</h1>
      <p>I intend this video to be projected onto a square, framed canvas in a gallery. It will serve as a substitute for a two-dimensional contemporary art piece. The video is meant to have qualities of a minimalist print. Similar to a real print, the video is essentially static in subject as it is one image looping repeatedly. The obvious difference is that it is constantly in motion.

The advent of every new art movement comes with controversy.  I wanted to touch on the implication of video art's slow integration into the world of high art. This is why it is projected on a blank canvas in a gallery environment. It also blatantly declares itself to be art with the phrase "this is art" scrolling through the animation. The words often feel jumbled due to them being in a constant loop. I hope that this causes some to misread the words as "is this art".   This calls back to the controversy of new art movements within the art world.</p>
