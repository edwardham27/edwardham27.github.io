     <h1>Edward Ham | Artist Statement (May 2020)</h1>
     <p>I am a digital media artist and student at San Jose State University. I enjoy exploring the relationship between modern design and the technology that serves as its medium. I see myself just as more of a designer than an artist. Because of this, my main focus in many of my works lay on the aesthetic level. My current work usually follows one of two paths. I’m either refining or practicing my technical skill by exploring new methods or software, or I am tinkering with ways to break or combine my learned skills to create something entirely new. I strive to learn a new skill or technique with every work I produce. Whether it is working with ai, ar, or video, I always enjoy creating something that has a vague atmosphere. I don’t take too much emphasis on concrete meaning or message in my work. Although I don’t discount meaning entirely, I enjoy creating works that convey very subtle emotion over an inherent message. I believe this philosophy has drawn me to the world of design. Because I am an art student however, I am often inclined to explore my own work and process through the artistic lens which I believe influences my attitude towards the art world. I am often finding myself criticizing the modern art scene with cynicism due to my preference toward design and technical execution over profoundness and message. Though I do not condemn higher art, I do have my personal preference of design and more kitsch aesthetics. I mostly enjoy working with motion graphics, vfx, and exploring cutting edge ai imagery tools.
